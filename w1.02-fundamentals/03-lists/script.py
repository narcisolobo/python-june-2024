In Python, arrays are called lists. 

Lists are ordered and changeable.

Lists allow duplicate values.

# List creation

# List indices
"""
Lists have indices just like arrays have indices in
JavaScript. They are zero-indexed as well.
"""

# List negative indices
"""
Python supports negative indices. A -1 index will refer
to the last element in a list.
"""

# Common list methods
"""
There are many useful methods we can use with lists.
"""

# length
"""
Pass a list to the len() method to return the number of
elements in the list.
"""

# append, remove, pop
"""
append() - adds an element to the end of a list.
remove() - removes the specified element from a list.
pop() - removes the element at the specified position
"""

# sort, reverse
"""
The sort() method sorts a list in ascending order in-place.
The reverse() method reverses a list.
