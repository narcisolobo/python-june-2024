# Python Operators
Here is a list of available operators in Python.

## Arithmetic Operators
| Operator | Description                  |
| -------- | ---------------------------- |
| +        | Addition                     |
| -        | Subtraction                  |
| *        | Multiplication               |
| /        | Division                     |
| %        | Modulus (Division Remainder) |
| **       | Exponentiation               |
| //       | Floor Division               |

## Assignment Operators
| Operator | Example | Same As    |
| -------- | ------- | ---------- |
| =        | x = y   | x = y      |
| +=       | x += y  | x = x + y  |
| -=       | x -= y  | x = x - y  |
| *=       | x *= y  | x = x * y  |
| /=       | x /= y  | x = x / y  |
| %=       | x %= y  | x = x % y  |
| **=      | x **= y | x = x ** y |
| //=      | x //= y | x = x // y |

## Comparison Operators
| Operator | Description              |
| -------- | ------------------------ |
| ==       | equal to                 |
| !=       | not equal                |
| >        | greater than             |
| <        | less than                |
| >=       | greater than or equal to |
| <=       | less than or equal to    |
| is       | object identity          |
| is not   | negated object identity  |
| in       | membership               |
| not in   | negated membership       |

## Logical Operators
| Operator | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| and      | logical and |
| or       | logical or  |
| not      | logical not |

## Identity Operators
| Operator | Description             |
| -------- | ----------------------- |
| is       | object identity         |
| is not   | negated object identity |

## Membership Operators
| Operator | Description        |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| in       | membership         |
| not in   | negated membership |

## Ternary Operator
| Operator | Example               | Equivalent            |
| -------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| if else  | x if condition else y | x if condition else y |
