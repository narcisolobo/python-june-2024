# Welcome to the Python Stack!

Congratulations on making it to the next stack. For most of you, this will be your first full-stack course. That means that we'll be creating web applications that combine all three components of a full-stack.

1. Client (front end)
2. Server (back end)
3. Database (also part of the back end)

## Full-Stack
Let's learn a little about each component of this full-stack.

### Jinja2
The front end of our applications will be utilizing [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/), a templating engine. The syntax of Jinja resembles HTML with extra features. We'll be able to write for loops and output variables in our HTML, for instance.

### Flask
Our server will be written in Python using the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) web framework. For each request that the client/front-end makes, we will learn how to handle those requests and send back the appropriate responses. When the user requests our home page, for example, we will write the logic that sends them the page.

### MySQL
We'll be using [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) as our database solution. MySQL stores its data in tables with rows and columns, much like a spreadsheet. We'll learn how to communicate (query) our database through the [SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/) language.
