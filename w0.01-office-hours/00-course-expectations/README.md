# Course Expectations and Guidelines
Welcome to the Python Stack! I am your instructor, Narciso "See-so" Lobo. 

## Course Requirements
1. Zero tolerance for abuse and dishonesty
2. At least 90% core assignment completion (15/16)
3. At least 70% attendance (discussion questions - check your catalog for particulars)
4. An orange, red, or black belt on the Python belt exam
5. Academic honesty ([refer to the platform](https://login.codingdojo.com/m/506/7941/59255) or to your catalog for particulars)

## Course Guidelines
1. If you are not speaking, please mute your mic.
2. I would love it if your cameras were on! It makes for a much-improved experience.
3. Please [raise your hand](https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb&sysparm_article=KB0068290) to ask a question if I'm currently speaking, or simply type your question in the zoom chat.
4. Participate! I'll periodically ask for feedback. Sometimes I'll ask questions regarding the assigned reading.
5. Do not compare yourself to anyone else. The only person you should be comparing yourself to is the coder you were yesterday.

## Flipped Classroom Model
1. Read tomorrow's material today.
2. Practice the ideas by completing assignments.
3. Refine them by diving deeper during Office Hour/Lectures.
4. There are also [prior lecture videos on the Learn Platform](https://login.codingdojo.com/m/506/9085/61634) that you can watch for a different perspective.

## 20-Minute Rule
Completing assignments in a timely fashion is critical during a bootcamp. We must always be pushing forward.

Coding Dojo has developed a technique we can follow to help us stay on pace. It's called "The 20-Minute Rule".

When your code does not do what it's supposed to do, start a 20-minute timer. Then go through these steps:
1. Try different things (debug using print statements, etc.)
2. Check the Learn Platform
3. Check official documentation
4. Search online (Stack Overflow, etc.)
5. Ask your cohort-mates (Discord)
6. Ask your TA or instructor (also Discord), *by the time you reach this step, it will have been at least 20 minutes*

## Student-Led Office Hours
On Friday of each week (except week 8), we will have student-led office hours. As each week progresses, I'll ask for volunteers.

6. Do I have to complete the practice assignments?
   1. No, only core assignments are required (90%).
